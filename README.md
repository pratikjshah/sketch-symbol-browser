## FAQ

<details><summary><b>Why is it taking so long for indexing?</b></summary>
<p>

Time required to index your Sketch Library is directly proportional to the size and number of symbols it has. But don't worry! This is a one time activity. 

*If you have suggestions on how can this be optimized, feel free to raise a pull request.*

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>My Library symbol update is not reflecting in Symbol Browser!</b></summary>
<p>

The plugin checks for the Sketch Library modification time and keeps indexing the change when you Open a new document or add a new Sketch Library. 

But in case you want to *force plugin to index again*, you can go to plugin menu and click `üßπ Clear Symbol Index` to remove cached symbols. So after this when you one the Symbol Browser, it will re-index Sketch Libraries.

<details><summary><b>How is this plugin different from 'Stickers'?</b></summary>
<p>

**Symbol Browser** is a forked version of Roman Nurik's [Sticker](https://github.com/romannurik/Sketch-Stickers) project.
  The goal of this sketch plugin is to provide additional features such as showing Sketch Library symbols along with the Stickers you have tagged.
