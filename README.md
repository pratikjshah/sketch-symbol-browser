<details><summary><b>What is a Sticker?</b></summary>
<p>

A sticker is nothing but a specially tagged layer item. 

This can be shape/text layer, group, artboard or even symbol instance. You can use Sticker as a component of your UI Kit which you repeatedly use and want to save time re-creating it.

Check a syntax <b>[cheatsheet for Stickers](https://github.com/pratikjshah/symbol-browser/wiki/Cheat-sheet-for-Stickers)</b> to explore what all you can do!

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>How do I add my custom stickers?</b></summary>
<p>

To add any layer as your Sticker, you just have to "specially" tag it. Take look at below image to see how you can tag an artboard, symbol instances and any layer or group.

<img src="https://github.com/pratikjshah/symbol-browser/blob/master/art/add-custom-stickers.png?raw=true" alt="Sketch Symbol Browser" width="100%" />

This tagging is a **suffix** which looks like this

<pre><code>
To tag a layer with Main Category
<b>Layer_Name <i>@MyStickers</i></b>

OR

To tag a layer under Sub Category
<b>Layer_Name <i>@MyStickers.InfoCards</i></b>


<sub><i>You can tag multiple layers with the same category.</i></sub>

</code></pre>


*Note: Here <b>MyStickers</b> and <b>InfoCards</b> are the defined categories.*

<details><summary><b>How to define Sticker categories?</b></summary>
<p>

Sticker categories are the logical sections you create to better distribute and logically group Stickers.
You can currently have 2 levels of category.

<img src="https://github.com/pratikjshah/symbol-browser/blob/master/art/define-categories.png?raw=true" alt="Sketch Symbol Browser" width="100%" />

```yaml
#To define Parent Category

!StickerSection @Section1                         # categoryId
title: My Stickers                                # Optional, if not provided uses categoryId, provides readable name
description: 'A description'                      # Optional, Supports basic HTML tags

```

```yaml
#To define Sub Category

!StickerSection @Section1.SubSection              # append subCatId to categoryId with .
title: Info Cards                                 # Optional, if not provided uses SubCatId
description: 'A description'                      # Optional, Supports basic HTML tags

```

<details><summary><b>Why is it taking so long for indexing?</b></summary>
<p>

Time required to index your Sketch Library is directly proportional to the size and number of symbols it has. But don't worry! This is a one time activity. 

*If you have suggestions on how can this be optimized, feel free to raise a pull request.*

</p>
</details>

<details><summary><b>My Library symbol update is not reflecting in Symbol Browser!</b></summary>
<p>

The plugin checks for the Sketch Library modification time and keeps indexing the change when you Open a new document or add a new Sketch Library. 

But in case you want to *force plugin to index again*, you can go to plugin menu and click `üßπ Clear Symbol Index` to remove cached symbols. So after this when you one the Symbol Browser, it will re-index Sketch Libraries.

<details><summary><b>How is this plugin different from 'Stickers'?</b></summary>
<p>

**Symbol Browser** is a forked version of Roman Nurik's [Sticker](https://github.com/romannurik/Sketch-Stickers) project.
  The goal of this sketch plugin is to provide additional features such as showing Sketch Library symbols along with the Stickers you have tagged.
